# Data Refresh
refresh button works.

cant seem to get page to refresh on form submit

###  FORMS HOW DO THEY WORK
### Answer: Strangely

 - CSS (take mobile-first approach)
 - K8s
 - (maybe) IaaC? Show-off Pulumi maybe? Seems unnecessary to the repo's purpose and will slow things down
 - README


#poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
